# When to Use Generics

After all this, you might be tempted to use generics everywhere. But like any tool, generics have their place. Here's when Ppt found them most useful:

1. **When you need the same functionality for different types**: Collections, data containers, result wrappers.
2. **When you want to preserve type information**: Instead of using `Object` and casting.
3. **When you want compile-time type safety**: Catching type errors before runtime.
4. **When you're building reusable components**: Libraries, frameworks, and utilities.

And here's when Ppt avoided them:

1. **When there's only one type you'll ever use**: No need for generics if you're only dealing with strings.
2. **When type erasure is a concern**: Remember that generic type information is erased at runtime.
3. **When it makes the code harder to understand**: Sometimes explicit types are clearer.

## Conclusion: Ppt's Transformation

By embracing generics, Ppt transformed his codebase:

- **Before**: 20+ similar classes for different data types
- **After**: ~5 generic classes that handled all data types

- **Before**: Code duplication everywhere
- **After**: Write once, use for any type

- **Before**: Runtime type errors when processing data
- **After**: Compile-time type checking

But most importantly, when a new data type was needed:

- **Before**: Write a new class, new processing logic, new storage handlers
- **After**: Just use the existing generic infrastructure

Now it's your turn. Look at your own codebaseâ€”where are you repeating yourself for different types? Where could generics make your code more concise, safer, and more flexible?

## Challenge Exercise

Before you go, I have a challenge for you. Try implementing a `Result<S, E>` class that represents either a success value of type `S` or an error value of type `E`. This pattern is common in languages like Rust and can greatly improve error handling in Dart. Here's a sketch to get you started:

```dart
class Result<S, E> {
  final S? _success;
  final E? _error;
  final bool isSuccess;
  
  Result.success(S value)
      : _success = value,
        _error = null,
        isSuccess = true;
  
  Result.error(E error)
      : _success = null,
        _error = error,
        isSuccess = false;
  
  // TODO: Implement methods like:
  // - getOrElse(S defaultValue)
  // - map<T>(T Function(S) mapper)
  // - mapError<F>(F Function(E) mapper)
  // - flatMap<T>(Result<T, E> Function(S) mapper)
}
```

See if you can complete this class and use it in a practical example. Good luck!
